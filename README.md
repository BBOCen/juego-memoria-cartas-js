<h1 align="center">🎮 Memory Game (Memory Card Game) 🎮</h1>

<p align="center">
  This project is an interactive game developed in JavaScript, designed to test your visual and logical memory while providing an engaging and fun experience. The game interface is dynamic, fully generated through code, and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
</p>

<h2>🚀 Main Features</h2>

<h3>🔹 Dynamic Board Generation</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Configurable board:</strong> The game generates a grid of cards whose size can be adjusted (4x4, 6x6, etc.), with cards distributed randomly to ensure a unique experience in each game.</li>
  <li><strong>Hidden cards:</strong> Each card has a uniform design at the beginning, hiding its unique content (pairs of images or attributes).</li>
</ul>

<h3>🔹 Card Interactivity</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Card flipping:</strong> By clicking on the cards, their content is revealed. The game allows you to flip a maximum of two cards at a time.</li>
  <li><strong>Matching logic:</strong> If the cards match, they remain uncovered. If they don't, they are flipped back after a brief interval, with smooth animations for a fluid experience.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🔹 Game State Management</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Victory check:</strong> The game detects when all cards have been uncovered and shows a congratulatory message: "You won!"</li>
  <li><strong>Restart game:</strong> A button allows you to restart the game, shuffling the cards and resetting the game state. You can also change the board size before starting a new game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🔹 Extras to Enhance the Experience</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Move counter:</strong> Tracks how many attempts you've made during the game.</li>
  <li><strong>Timer:</strong> Times how long it takes to complete the game, adding an extra challenge.</li>
</ul>
